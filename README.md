# Unhingen
### Unhingen is a super fast, super cool 2D and 3D game development framework. 
##### <sup><sub>as if there weren't enough already...</sub></sup>

# What does it provide?
Uhingen is written in C++ and meant to be used with C++. It's goal is to wrap up a lot of the 
down and dirty stuff that one would need to do to make a game. It's hard stuff, and like you we just want to 
make games. However Unhingen also exposes a lot of *low level* functionality for those of you that need to get
fancy with it and have a lot of control.

## Goals:
* Easy and robust 2D support
* A super optimized game loop
* A more or less declaritive way to interface with the framework.
  * Just define some callbacks and then fire up the Unhingen gameloop and off you go.
* Compile to C++ and to **WebAssembly**!
* Input handling
* Sound engine
* Maybe android support one of these days.

#### Building from source
* tell people how to do this...

#### Linux
* todo

#### VS2015
* todo

#### Dependencies
* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* Other things, need to update this list.

#### The faces of Team Unhinged
* Daniel Hill - *「the Guy」* - seriously he does a lot of cool stuff with the graphics code.
* Cory Sabol - *「コーヒーボーイー」* - painstakingly crafts bugs from scratch with love.
